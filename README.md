# Diagnosis_of_COVID-19_and_its_clinical_spectrum
This project aims to predict if a patient is infected with COVID-19, given a set of clinical features.


The World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, as a pandemic on March 11, while the exponential increase in the number of cases was risking to overwhelm health systems around the world with a demand for ICU beds far above the existing capacity, with regions of Italy being prominent examples.

Brazil recorded the first case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 26, and the virus transmission evolved from imported cases only, to local and finally community transmission very rapidly, with the federal government declaring nationwide community transmission on March 20.

Until March 27, the state of São Paulo had recorded 1,223 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 68 related deaths, while the county of São Paulo, with a population of approximately 12 million people and where Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein is located, had 477 confirmed cases and 30 associated death, as of March 23. Both the state and the county of São Paulo decided to establish quarantine and social distancing measures, that will be enforced at least until early April, in an effort to slow the virus spread
